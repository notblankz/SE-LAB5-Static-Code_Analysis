# Software Engineering Lab: Static Analysis

This repository is a fork for a Software Engineering course lab. The purpose of this lab was to learn how to use static analysis tools to identify, analyze, and refactor an existing codebase.

## Lab Overview

We were provided with the initial `inventory_system.py` file, which contained various bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code style issues.

My work in this repo involved:
1.  **Analysis**: Running `pylint`, `flake8`, and `bandit` on the original file to generate initial reports.
2.  **Documentation**: Compiling the findings into a "Known Issue Table" to prioritize and plan the fixes.
3.  **Refactoring**: Systematically fixing all identified issues, resulting in the `fix_inventory_system.py` file.
4.  **Verification**: Running the analysis tools again on the fixed file to ensure all issues were resolved.
5.  **Reflection**: Writing a short `reflection.md` file about the process.

## Repository Contents

* `pre_fix_reports/`: Contains the initial static analysis reports from `pylint`, `flake8`, and `bandit` for the original file.
* `post_fix_reports/`: Contains the final analysis reports for the refactored code, showing the fixed issues.
* `inventory_system.py`: The original, buggy Python file provided for the lab.
* `fix_inventory_system.py`: The final, refactored, and clean version of the code.
* `inventory.json`: A data file generated by the Python script to store inventory.
* `reflection.md`: A brief reflection on the lab.
